GEM GAF-DB Miscellaneous Faults
===============================

This repository hosts a GIS file of miscellaneous faults for inclusion in the 
[GEM Global Active Faults Database (GEM 
GAF-DB)](https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gem-global-active-faults). The 
faults in this file are additions to regional datasets that aren't managed by 
GEM (or by Richard Styron). Beyond that, there is no criteria for inclusion 
other than that the current GEM GAF-DB compilation either doens't have a gi ven 
structure or that a more accurate or metadata-complete representation of a 
structure exists.
